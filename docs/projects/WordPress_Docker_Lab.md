## Quickstart
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running.
2. Clone this repository.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibog1/-wordpress-docker-lab.git
cd -wordpress-docker-lab
```


3. Create the `.env` file from the template and >adjust values if needed:
```bash
cp example.env .env
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Adjust values if needed** in `.env` **before** starting containers!

4. Run `docker compose up -d`.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
5. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and complete the WordPress installation wizard.


5. Complete the WordPress installation wizard and create an admin user.
  You can then log in at `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin`.


## Usage


This section describes how to start, stop and test the WordPress Docker setup.


### Starting and stopping the stack


Start the containers in the background:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```


Stop the containers but keep the data:


```bash
docker compose down
```


Completely remove containers and volumes (all data will be removed):


```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Verifying data persistence


1. Log in to the WordPress admin at `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin`.
2. Create a visible test post (for example *“DevSecOps Persistence Test”*) and publish it.
3. Restart the stack:


```bash
docker compose down
```
```bash
docker compose up -d
```


4. Open `http://localhost:8080` again and verify that the test post is still present.  
If the post is still visible, the database and WordPress files are correctly persisted in Docker volumes.


## Configuration


The stack is defined in `docker-compose.yaml` and uses environment variables from an `.env` file.


> **Note**  
> Never commit your `.env` file or real credentials to the repository.  
> The `.env` file is meant to stay local on your machine or server.


### Environment variables


An example configuration is provided in `example.env`.


1. Copy the example file
2. Edit `.env` and set your own database credentials and passwords.
3. Start the stack with:


```bash
docker compose up -d
```

In `docker-compose.yaml` both services reference these variables via `env_file` and `${VAR}` syntax, so no credentials are stored directly in the compose file.
